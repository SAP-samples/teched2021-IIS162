In this session you experience how SAP Cloud ALM can help you in adoption of the Intelligent Enterprise and accelerating your implementation projects. 

You will experience end-to-end how the tool supports the implementation journey:

Starting with setting up the project, timelines and onboarding the team in Cloud ALM you will then model your own proces and scope the processes to be implemented as part of the project. Then you will be creating requirements as part of the fit-to-standard workshops and divide the business requirements into user stories describing what needs to be done. As a next step, a manual test case is created and tested before releasing the transports with the help of a feature in SAP Cloud ALM.

During this project journey guided by SAP Cloud ALM you can track and trace the status of the project and its entities in the project dashboard and with the help of the Analytics apps.

Now you can get started. We hope you enjoy the session.

â€‹Cheers, Your SAP Cloud ALM team
