# Exercise 1 - Project Setup

In this exercise, we will create a Project. Projects are the key entities to facilitate SAP implementations. 

Projects can be equipped with project templates to best support different kind of implementaitons e.g. SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, or Intelligent Enterprise Suite focussed implementations. 
Projects also provide a time boxing and defines the teams and concrete persons doing the project work.
