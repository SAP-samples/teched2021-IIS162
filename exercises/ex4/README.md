# Exercise 4 - Determinde the Project Implementation Scope

Do you remember the two elements that make the project scope?  It was both the Solution Processes and needed to be implemented or developed. 

Now it's time for the Fit-to-Standard Workshops to find out what Requirements are needed to be taken into consideration.
